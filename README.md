# Meta MCP Server

**MCP server for the Meta Marketing API — integrates with Claude Desktop and Claude Code.**

Ask Claude to manage your Facebook, Instagram, and Threads ad campaigns using plain language. No marketing dashboard needed.

---

## What You Can Do

- **Query** — campaign performance, insights by breakdown (age, country, placement, device), period-over-period intelligence reports, full pixel funnel breakdown (view_content → add_to_cart → initiate_checkout → purchase) on every insights response
- **Create** — full campaigns (Campaign + Ad Set + Ad) in one atomic call with automatic rollback on failure; supports special ad categories, UTM tags, custom conversion events, and destination types
- **DCO** — Dynamic Creative Optimization: give Claude 2–10 images and 2–5 headlines/bodies, Meta tests all combinations automatically
- **Duplicate** — deep-copy campaigns, ad sets, and creatives with overrides via Meta's async API
- **Automate** — create, enable/disable automated rules that pause high-CPA ad sets, scale winning budgets, or send alerts
- **Audiences** — customer list, lookalike, website pixel, Page/Instagram engagement, and video view retargeting audiences
- **Lead forms** — create native Facebook lead gen forms (with multiple-choice questions, locale, quality optimization) and retrieve lead submissions
- **Conversions API** — send server-side events with automatic SHA-256 PII hashing for iOS 14+ signal recovery
- **Catalogs** — list product catalogs, products, and product sets for Dynamic Product Ads
- **A/B Testing** — create 50/50 split tests comparing campaigns on creative, placement, targeting, or budget optimization
- **Targeting research** — search interests, behaviors, demographics, and geo locations; estimate audience size before spending
- **Pixels** — list pixels and view event statistics
- **Library** — browse the Meta Ads Library for competitive intelligence; manage ad image and video assets
- **Debug** — diagnose why an ad isn't delivering
- **Attribution** — configure attribution windows per-breakdown or per-report (1d/7d/28d click + 1d/7d view)

All write operations support **DRY_RUN mode** — simulate any action without touching live data.

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone and build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adynami/meta-mcp-server.git
cd meta-mcp-server
npm install
npm run build
```

### 2. Authenticate

```bash
npm run setup
```

This opens a browser window for Facebook login, obtains a 60-day access token, and writes it to your Claude Desktop config automatically.

For a non-expiring System User token (recommended for production):

```bash
npm run setup-system-user
```

### 3. Configure Claude Desktop

After running `npm run setup`, the config is written automatically. Restart Claude Desktop to activate the tools.

Manual config (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "meta-marketing": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/meta-mcp-server/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "META_ACCESS_TOKEN": "your_token",
        "META_AD_ACCOUNT_ID": "act_123456789",
        "META_API_VERSION": "v25.0",
        "DRY_RUN": "false"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 4. Start using it

Ask Claude:

**Reporting**
- *"Give me an account intelligence report for last 30 days"*
- *"Break down performance by country for the last 14 days — which markets have the best ROAS?"*
- *"Compare our 7-day click vs 1-day click attribution on the Sales campaign"*

**Campaigns**
- *"Search for yoga and meditation interests, estimate the audience size for US women 25–44, then launch a $50/day awareness campaign"*
- *"Create an A/B test comparing campaign A vs B on creative for 14 days"*
- *"Duplicate campaign 120215... with a new landing page URL and $75/day budget"*

**Automation & Audiences**
- *"Create a rule that pauses any ad set with CPA over $80 after $200 spent"*
- *"Build a retargeting audience of people who watched 50%+ of our product video"*
- *"Create a lookalike from our purchaser list and launch a $100/day campaign targeting US"*

**E-commerce & Leads**
- *"Send a server-side Purchase event for order #4521, $149, customer email john@example.com"*
- *"List our product catalogs and show the first 10 products in the main catalog"*
- *"Create a lead form with name, email, and a multiple-choice question asking budget range"*

## Integration with image-gen-mcp

Pair this server with [image-gen-mcp](https://github.com/adynami/image-gen-mcp) to generate ad creatives with Google Imagen 4 and deploy them directly to Meta — all in one Claude conversation:

1. *"Generate 3 variations of a fitness ad image with a clean white background"* → `imagen_generate`
2. *"Upload the first one and create a sales campaign"* → `meta_upload_image` → `meta_deploy_campaign`
3. *"Now run DCO with all 3 images and 2 headline variants"* → `meta_deploy_dco_campaign`
